My platform of choice is <strong>Ethereum</strong>, but if you ask nicely I can deploy projects onto a centralized server.<br> I also develop tools to manage and automate nodes on various <strong>blockchain platforms</strong>, and write <strong>smart contracts</strong> using solidity. I can talk about <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> and brewing beer for hours at a time.<br> I almost forget to mention <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.",
